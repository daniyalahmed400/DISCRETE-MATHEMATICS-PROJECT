### DISCRETE-MATHEMATICS-PROJECT
# PROJECT: RSA-CRYPTOGRAPHY MESSAGE ENCODER & DECODER WITH USER PROVIDED KEY

### SOFTWARE DETAILS:
Python 3.6 and to design the form PyQt5 Designer

### PROJECT DETAILS:
We will design GUI using PyQt5 designer and  implement a message encryption-decryption application according to the Vigenere cipher, which can encrypt the message using the key and can decrypt the encrypted hash using same key(Symmetric).

Encryption:
The plaintext(P) and key(K) are added modulo Z.
Ei = (Pi + Ki) mod Z

Decryption:
Di = (Ei - Ki + Z) mod Z
